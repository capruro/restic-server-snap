## Configuration and Daemon Management

To simplify management of the REST server daemon, a configuration file (`rest-server.conf`) is provided in the snap package. This file allows you to easily customize the behavior of the REST server without modifying the wrapper script or service definition.

### Location

The configuration file is located at:

  `/var/snap/restic-server/common/rest-server.conf`

### Usage

1. Edit the configuration file to set your desired options (such as data directory, authentication, TLS, etc.).
2. After making changes, restart the daemon to apply the new configuration:

     `sudo snap restart restic-server`

The wrapper script (`rest-server-wrapper.sh`) automatically loads and applies the settings from `rest-server.conf` when starting the REST server.

This approach makes it easy to manage and update the service configuration, ensuring changes are persistent and straightforward.
